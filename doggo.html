              <!-- Requirement-1.Q -->
              <summary>Why is she named Kitty?</summary>
              I was initially a cat person who had wanted a pet cat so we
              settled by naming her Kitty.

            <details>
              <summary>Is she as cute as she looks?</summary>
              Yes, but don't let that fool you. She will attempt to murder any
              other animal that comes near her and can get very loud.
            </details>
            <details>
              <summary>Does she have siblings?</summary>
              Yes, 1 brother named Tomi or Tô Mì (Vietnamese for noodle bowl)
              who lives with my uncle and his family.
