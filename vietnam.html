      <h2>â€¢ Da Nang, Viá»‡t Nam</h2>
      <p>
        My family's second destination after landing in SÃ i GÃ²n (Ho Chi Minh
        City), Da Nang is a coastal city located in central Viá»‡t Nam and home to
        ChÃ¹a Linh á»¨ng, a Buddhist temple with a 220 foot statue of Lady Buddha
        as pictured. Standing so large, the statue could be seen from our hotel
        over 30 miles away. Like the rest of the country, there were many stray
        dogs residing on the temple grounds and were very friendly to tourists,
        almost as if they were sacred space's guardians. After a long morning of
        exploring the expansive temple, I had the best bowl of mÃ¬ quáº£ng that I
        ever had in my life.

      <h2>â€¢ Há»™i An, Viá»‡t Nam</h2>
      <p>
        Following our 3 days in Da Nang, our family set off for the neighboring
        city of Há»™i An. Famous for trading posts and markets along the Thu Bá»“n
        river, Há»™i An was beautifully decorated with lanterns for their Lunar
        New Year lantern festival. Our family was lucky to visit during Táº¿t
        preparation, but unfortunate when we had to leave Viá»‡t Nam right as the
        Lunar New Year arrived. However, Há»™i An was a highlight for another
        Buddhist temple we visited during the day and bustling festival at
        night. In addition, we had the best food at Cao láº§u KhÃ´ng Gian Xanh
        (10/10 would recommend). Shout out to the Mr. Bean-themed bar as well.

      <h2>Overall Thoughts</h2>
      <p>
        Viá»‡t Nam was a beautiful experience thanks to all my family who had
        welcomed us lovingly. Though not perfect and not without illness, my
        trip was one to remember forever and I hope to visit again soon!
